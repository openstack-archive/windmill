Description
-----------

Windmill is a collection of Ansible playbooks and roles used to deploy
Continuous Integration (CI) tools. It serves to be a functional test environment
for our Ansible CI roles primarily, however it also provides an example
deployment for users.

Quickstart
----------

The following is a list of instructions to get started quickly with an
all-in-one deployment.

* sudo yum update -y && reboot
* sudo yum install git epel-release
* sudo yum install python-dev python-tox python-pip gcc
* pip install --user zuul
* git clone https://github.com/openstack/windmill
* cd windmill

Before running the following command, you need to remove `zuul` from the
`requirements.txt` file. This is a temporary work around for now and will
change in the future.

Additionall, modify the `playbooks/vars/nodepool.yaml` file and update
`nodepool_template_clouds_yaml_contents` variable for launching nodepool
instances in your cloud infrastructure.

* tox -edeploy
